# Business Impact Analysis

The migration was not just a technical success, but a financial one.

| Metric | Pre-Migration (Monolith) | Post-Migration (Microservices) | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deployment Frequency** | Once per month | Multiple times per day | +2,000% |
| **Mean Time to Recovery** | 4.5 hours | 12 minutes | -95% |
| **Cloud Infrastructure Cost**| $850k/year | $450k/year | **$400k Savings** |
| **System Uptime** | 99.5% | 99.99% | "Four Nines" |

### Key Takeaway
By decoupling the **Telemetry Service**, we stopped the entire system from crashing during high-traffic usage spikes, which previously cost the company ~$50k per hour in downtime.
